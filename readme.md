#The De-Stress App

### Link to Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/ELqOkVwW/project-two

## About My App

#### I decided to do an app based on the concept of providing inspirational quotes & advice on a variety of general life stressors. I wanted to allow users to peruse content by category, and allow them to upload new quotes and images, and allow all users to upvote on content and display by most popular.

## Challenges

#### For me the biggest challenge at first was ceating the right routes in my app.rb file and making sure it corresponded to the right .erb file. Then I had to make a seed file with my quotes and images.

## Acknowledgements

#### I received help and advice from a number of fellow developers, including Matt S., Min, Wayne, and Vanessa. A big thanks goes to my consultant Alex for guiding and troubleshooting my project. And the evening T.A.s helped with last-minute issues I had.
